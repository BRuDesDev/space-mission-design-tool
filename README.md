### 📣 Overview:

The Space Mission Design Tool is an interactive application for visualizing 
and simulating space missions. It allows users to plot planetary orbits, calculate 
optimal transfer maneuvers (e.g., Hohmann transfers), and animate celestial bodies 
based on real-world physics. Designed for both enthusiasts and professionals, this 
tool brings space mission planning to life with an intuitive interface.

### 🌟 Features:

🌍 **Planetary System Simulation** – Using real-world physics, model planets orbiting sun. 
                                                 
🔄 **Animated Orbits** – Watch planets move dynamically along their orbits.

🛰️ **Mission Planning Tools** – Calculate and visualize Hohmann transfers and trajectories.

🔍 **Zoom & Pan Controls** – Navigate the simulation space by zooming with mouse wheel

🎛️ **Customizable Toolbar** – Tools to clear plotted missions, reset views, and more.

📡 **Real-World Data Integration** – Fetch accurate planetary data from NASA APIs.

🖥️ **Cross-Platform** – Built aesthetic UI desktop experience compatable on Windows/MacOSX/Linux.
